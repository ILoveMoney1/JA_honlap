    <h1>Spider-Man</h1>

    <p>
        Spider-Man is a superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in
        the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He appears in
        American comic books published by Marvel Comics and in movies, television shows, and video game adaptations set
        in the Marvel Universe. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben
        in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the
        character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting characters,
        such as J. Jonah Jameson, Harry Osborn, romantic interests Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson, and foes such as
        Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin and Venom. In his origin story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite
        from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting
        danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider
        webs of his own design.

        When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to
        the
        role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school
        student from Queens behind Spider-Man's secret identity and with whose "self-obsessions with rejection,
        inadequacy,
        and loneliness" young readers could relate.[9] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike
        previous
        teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus
        had
        to learn for himself that "with great power there must also come great responsibility"â€”a line included in a text
        box
        in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, his late
        Uncle
        Ben Parker.
